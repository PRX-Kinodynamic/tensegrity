# Interface
Code to interface between different robots (and potentially a simulator).
The main idea is to make algorithms/code robot independent as much as possible.

Algorithm -> interface -> robot


## Structure:
 * config: Configuration files
 * include: Headers
 * launch: Launch files 
 * scripts: Python files
 * src: cpp and nodelets
 * tests: Google test files
